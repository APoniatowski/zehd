## [1.5.2] - 28-07-2024
### Updated
- made the config initialization more visual (orange for default and green for configured)
- fixed a bug, where it only fetched the code and not merge it (ala pull), I renamed the private function from gitFetcher() to gitPull(), instead of creating a private pull function to be called in gitFetcher()
