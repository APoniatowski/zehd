# Initial push changelog

- HTML and goHTML template parsing (layout+template and individual files, without a layout)
- Org(-mode) file conversion and parsing
- MD (Markdown) file conversion and parsing
- Caching implemented to avoid reading files from disk, every time the page is called, and avoid
  server/service restarts
- Paths are automatically created, no extra steps needed (eg. example.com/path/to/page)
- Basic kubernetes health and readiness checks are implemented
- Data collection implemented (collected via HEADER, this can be spoofed, unfortunately)
- Data collected, forwards data to backend, which is setup, via environment variable:
  BACKEND=<http://YourBackend.example.com:8080>

## extra notes

     - add port number and "http://" in your .env file (an example is included), or exported one way or another
     - an example service file has been included. There will be an official one, but this is one I currently use (just edited to suite my environment)
     - having the backend node, is not required to function.
