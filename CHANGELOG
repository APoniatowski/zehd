## [1.5.0] - 13-11-2024
### Added
- Added git functionality, so that one does not have to upload, or automate updates to you website
- It can either use a password or token (with the correct permissions, it is up to the user how open they want their token to be if it gets leaked)
- Changed to scratch image for docker, it managed to reduce the size by another couple of MB
- bumped the go version in the go.mod file
- made the http handler use a switch for GET and POST, where I have an idea with POST
- reworked how the env vars initialize and how it should visually display how much is configured to the user
- added ability to disable static paths individually, as well as change them to custom paths (css, js, images and downloads)
